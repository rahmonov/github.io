Summary: My experience of giving a talk for the first time in front of a relatively big audience

At Super Dispatch, we have this event so-called "Friday Talks" where all the people gather up and one person gives a talk on a topic
of his own choice. This is done in order to foster a culture of knowledge sharing and growth. As a software developer at Super Dispatch,
I have regularly been giving talks at this event. The topics I talked about include:
 
- [How to write clean functions](/posts/how-to-write-clean-functions/)
- [Introduction to GraphQL in Python](http://graphql.org/) 
- [Deploying Django apps using Kubernetes on GCP](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Practical Guide to Test Driven Development with Django

and a few more others. This has been an awesome experience for a number of reasons. For one thing, I learned a lot of things in the
process of getting prepared for the talks and filled lots of gaps in my knowledge of things I thought I knew well. For another, 
I overcame my fear of talking to an audience because it is much easier to give a talk to your colleagues than to complete strangers. 
Besides, I learned how to structure my thoughts into an organized talk. 
 
However, I have never stood up in the stage all alone in front of <strike>all these monsters who are getting ready to eat me up</strike>
a big number of people whose first thought, I think, would be: "Okay, this guy is giving a talk so he should be an expert". WHAT???
What if I screw up and make fun of myself? What if somebody records how I screw up and puts it on YouTube? <i class="em em-scream"></i> 
Okay, I am joking here, that would have been awesome and fun to watch. But the fear was real.
 
However, I as read more [books](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397) and [articles](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2015/01/05/24-quick-tips-to-boost-your-career-as-a-software-engineer-this-year/) 
on how to build a good career as a developer, I realized that getting yourself out there by starting a blog or giving a talk is essential to be successful in this industry.
So, when it was announced that [Google IO Extended](https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/?ref=br_rs) was happening in Tashkent, I knew that it was my chance to get started in this speaking journey.

So, I went ahead and submitted a talk. And the rest is history...okay, I am joking again. No history here, just an ordinary tech even, phew <i class="em em-sleepy"></i>  
 
Thankfully, the organizers accepted my talk and announced it on the event page:

I was proud and terrified at the same time. Some of the other talks included:

- [How to develop a web service in Golang and deploy it using Docker by Diyor Islomov](https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/photos/a.902471193144035.1073741828.902460013145153/1414752278582588/?type=3&permPage=1)
- [Prototyping apps for non-programmers by Vlad Azimhodjaev](https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/photos/a.902471193144035.1073741828.902460013145153/1415300861861063/?type=3)
- [Game/CGI characters creation process by Bekzod Fayozov](https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/photos/a.902471193144035.1073741828.902460013145153/1416110071780142/?type=3)
- [Welcome to journey of JavaScript by Farrux Mamatxalilov](https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/photos/a.902471193144035.1073741828.902460013145153/1416861721704977/?type=3)
- [Virtual Reality: Status Quo and the potential of the market by Shakhruz Ashirov](https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/photos/a.902471193144035.1073741828.902460013145153/1420533894671093/?type=3)

So the day came and I gave my talk called "How we deploy our Django apps now and where we are going". It was split into three parts.

- The past: when we deployed everything manually and depended on the ninja develop who was the only one who knew how to do things
- The present: when we are using CI and CD to deploy our apps automatically
- The future: when we plan to use Docker, Kubernetes and CI&CD to deploy our apps

It went pretty well. At least, better than I thought it would be. The audience was great. They laughed at approximately half of my jokes.
But hey, 50% is not that bad for the first time <i class="em em-sunglasses"></i>

After my talk ended, several people approached me with questions and some of them got my contacts. Honestly, I felt like a super star.

##Conclusion
I know that it is not a huge thing to accomplish but I was and still am excited about what happened. The most important thing is that I
learned a ton.

I experienced what it is like to be talking to more than 10 people. I improved my presentation skills. I answered the audience's questions.
I got to meet some awesome people. <s>Some people got to meet me, the humblest person on this planet <i class="em em-grin"></i></s> 

Overall, I think that it was a step forward in my career and I will continue to grab such opportunities to speak in the future as well.
Also, I recommend that you do the same, no matter what you do. Getting oneself out there is what differentiates the successful from the average.

Thanks for reading <i class="em em-innocent"></i> and fight on <i class="em em-muscle"></i>
