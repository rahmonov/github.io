<h1>I gave a talk at Google IO Extended 2017</h1>

<p>At Super Dispatch, we have this event so-called "Friday Talks" where all the people gather up and one person gives a talk on a topic
of his own choice. This is done in order to foster a culture of knowledge sharing and growth. As a software developer at Super Dispatch,
I have regularly been giving talks at this event. The topics I talked about include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/how-to-write-clean-functions/">How to write clean functions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://graphql.org/">Introduction to GraphQL in Python</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Deploying Django apps using Kubernetes on GCP</a></li>
<li>Practical Guide to Test Driven Development with Django</li>
</ul>
<p>and a few more others. This has been an awesome experience for a number of reasons. For one thing, I learned a lot of things in the
process of getting prepared for the talks and filled lots of gaps in my knowledge of things I thought I knew well. For another, 
I overcame my fear of talking to an audience because it is much easier to give a talk to your colleagues than to complete strangers. 
Besides, I learned how to structure my thoughts into an organized talk. </p>
<p>However, I have never stood up in the stage all alone in front of <strike>all these monsters who are getting ready to eat me up</strike>
a big number of people whose first thought, I think, would be: "Okay, this guy is giving a talk so he should be an expert". WHAT???
What if I screw up and make fun of myself? What if somebody records how I screw up and puts it on YouTube? <i class="em em-scream"></i> 
Okay, I am joking here, that would have been awesome and fun to watch. But the fear was real.</p>
<p>However, I as read more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397">books</a> and <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/2015/01/05/24-quick-tips-to-boost-your-career-as-a-software-engineer-this-year/">articles</a> 
on how to build a good career as a developer, I realized that getting yourself out there by starting a blog or giving a talk is essential to be successful in this industry.
So, when it was announced that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iutextended/?ref=br_rs">Google IO Extended</a> was happening in Tashkent, I knew that it was my chance to get started in this speaking journey. </p>

        <span>Event organizers and participants</span>
    </a>
</div>

<p>So, I went ahead and submitted a talk. And the rest is history...okay, I am joking again. No history here, just an ordinary tech even, phew <i class="em em-sleepy"></i>  </p>
<p>Thankfully, the organizers accepted my talk and announced it on the event page: </p>

</div>

<p>I was proud and terrified at the same time. Some of the other talks included:</p>

</ul>
<p>So the day came and I gave my talk called "How we deploy our Django apps now and where we are going". It was split into three parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The past: when we deployed everything manually and depended on the ninja develop who was the only one who knew how to do things</li>
<li>The present: when we are using CI and CD to deploy our apps automatically</li>
<li>The future: when we plan to use Docker, Kubernetes and CI&amp;CD to deploy our apps</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>It went pretty well. At least, better than I thought it would be. The audience was great. They laughed at approximately half of my jokes.
But hey, 50% is not that bad for the first time <i class="em em-sunglasses"></i> </p>
<div class="gallery medium">
    <a href="/static/images/post-images/i-gave-a-talk/audience.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Audience">
        <img src="/static/images/post-images/i-gave-a-talk/audience.jpg" alt="Audience">
    </a>
</div>

<p>After my talk ended, several people approached me with questions and some of them got my contacts. Honestly, I felt like a super star.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I know that it is not a huge thing to accomplish but I was and still am excited about what happened. The most important thing is that I
learned a ton.</p>
<p>I experienced what it is like to be talking to more than 10 people. I improved my presentation skills. I answered the audience's questions.
I got to meet some awesome people. <s>Some people got to meet me, the humblest person on this planet <i class="em em-grin"></i></s> </p>
<p>Overall, I think that it was a step forward in my career and I will continue to grab such opportunities to speak in the future as well.
Also, I recommend that you do the same, no matter what you do. Getting oneself out there is what differentiates the successful from the average.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading <i class="em em-innocent"></i> and fight on <i class="em em-muscle"></i></p>
